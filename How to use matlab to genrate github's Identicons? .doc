  GitHub genrate unique Identicon for everyone who join it. Identicons are simple 5x5 "pixel" sprites that are generated using a hash of the user's ID.The algorithm walks through the hash and turns pixels on or off depending on even or odd values. These generated patterns, combined with hash-determined color values, ensures a huge number of unique Identicons. 

Let's use Matlab to generate hash value:
 Function: hash
% HASH - Convert an input variable into a message digest using any of
%        several common hash algorithms
%
% USAGE: h = hash(inp,'meth')
%
% inp  = input variable, of any of the following classes:
%        char, uint8, logical, double, single, int8, uint8,
%        int16, uint16, int32, uint32, int64, uint64
% h    = hash digest output, in hexadecimal notation
% meth = hash algorithm, which is one of the following:
%        MD2, MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-384, or SHA-512  
%
% NOTES: (1) If the input is a string or uint8 variable, it is hashed
%            as usual for a byte stream. Other classes are converted into
%            their byte-stream values. In other words, the hash of the
%            following will be identical:
%                     'abc'
%                     uint8('abc')
%                     char([97 98 99])
%            The hash of the follwing will be different from the above,
%            because class "double" uses eight byte elements:
%                     double('abc')
%                     [97 98 99]
%            You can avoid this issue by making sure that your inputs
%            are strings or uint8 arrays.
%        (2) The name of the hash algorithm may be specified in lowercase
%            and/or without the hyphen, if desired. For example,
%            h=hash('my text to hash','sha256');
%        (3) Carefully tested, but no warranty. Use at your own risk.
%        (4) Michael Kleder, Nov 2005

% EXAMPLE:
%
% algs={'MD2','MD5','SHA-1','SHA-256','SHA-384','SHA-512'};
% for n=1:6
%     h=hash('my sample text',algs{n});
%     disp([algs{n} ' (' num2str(length(h)*4) ' bits):'])
%     disp(h)
% end

h = hash('xhz','MD2');

Then turn h to (h)2.
